## Test Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
|  Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Mercury Years.| 33 Earth Yrs | 33 / 11.86 = Mercury Yrs
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Venus Years. | 33 Earth Yrs | 33 / 11.86 = = 3.23 Venus Yrs |
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Mars Years. |  33 Earth Yrs  | 33 / 11.86 = 17.55 Mars Yrs |
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Mars Years. |  33 Earth Yrs  | 33 / 11.86 = 2.782 Mars Years |
| On click event on a card, display card contents | flip any card | card should flip and reveal color |
| On click event on a second card | flip another card | second card should flip and reveal color |
| Check for match on the first and the second flip, If same color appear keep them open| second click on another card should flip it | If the first and the second card flip match, keep cards open |
| Check for match on the first and the second flip, if different pictures appear flip them back to close| second click on another card should flip it | If the first and the second card flip do not match, close the cards|
| Player should not be able to play further until two flips are compared for a match or a mismatch | third click | 1. If the first and the second card flip do not match, close the cards  2. If the first and the second card flip match, open the cards|
