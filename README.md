## Test Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
|  Program takes a user's date of birth and calculate Earth years.| Year: 1985, Month: 3, Date: 5 | 33.85 Earth years
|  Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Mercury Years.| 33 Earth Yrs | 33 / .24 = 137.5 Mercury Yrs
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Venus Years. | 33 Earth Yrs | 33 / .62 = = 53.23 Venus Yrs |
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Mars Years. |  33 Earth Yrs  | 33 / 1.88 = 17.55 Mars Yrs |
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and converts to Jupiter Years. |  33 Earth Yrs  | 33 / 11.86 = 2.78 Jupiter Years |
| Program takes a user's age in Earth years and gives life expectancy in selected planet's years. |  User Age = 33 Earth Years, User Earth Life Expectancy = 75, User Mars Life Expectancy = 39.89 Mars Years   | Life Expectancy in Mars Years = 22.34 Mars Years |
| Program takes a user's age and calculates how many years a user has lived longer on a selected planet based on life expectancy. |  User Age = 79 Earth Years, User Earth Life Expectancy = 75, User Mars Life Expectancy = 39.89 Mars Years   | Years past Life Expectancy in Mars = 22.34 Mars Years |
